## üß∞ Project Overview

The `productmanagerapi` is structured to provide a modular and scalable approach to product management through a RESTful API. The project is organized into several key directories:

* **`cmd/`**: Contains the main application entry point.
* **`config/`**: Houses configuration files and settings.
* **`controllers/`**: Defines the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
* **`models/`**: Contains the data models representing the application's core entities.
* **`responseFormatter/`**: Manages the formatting of API responses.
* **`routes/`**: Sets up the API endpoints and routing logic.
* **`types/`**: Defines custom types used across the application.
* **`utils/`**: Provides utility functions to support various operations.

The presence of `go.mod` and `go.sum` files indicates that the project uses Go modules for dependency management.

## üìö API Usage

While specific API endpoints are not detailed in the repository, based on standard RESTful practices and the directory structure, we can anticipate the following endpoints:

* **GET** `/products`: Retrieve a list of all products.
* **GET** `/products/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific product by ID.
* **POST** `/products`: Create a new product.
* **PUT** `/products/{id}`: Update an existing product by ID.
* **DELETE** `/products/{id}`: Delete a product by ID.

These endpoints would typically accept and return JSON-formatted data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Configuration settings are likely managed within the `config/` directory. This may include settings such as:

* Server port and host
* Database connection strings

Ensure that any necessary environment variables or configuration files are set up before running the application.

## üß™ Testing the API

To test the API endpoints, you can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl`. For example, to retrieve all products:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/products
```



Replace `localhost:8080` with the appropriate host and port if different.
